# vue-uikit-starter
Basic vue.js and uikit starter app powered by laravel mix

# Why vue.js?
Vue.js is a really great javascript framework that offers great modular design and highly is flexible.  
It is a fast and high performance framework that is gaining more and more popularity.

# Why UIkit?
UIkit is a very clean and feature packed frontend framework. Although it is not as famous as twitter bootstrap and SemanticUI, 
it has a nice charm to it. It is my favorite frontend framework.

# Why laravel mix?
Laravel mix is an API layer for webpack and offers a lot of basic functionality that most normal developer needs out of the box.  
Configuring webpack config for simple task can be very, very tricky and messy especially for newcomers. Laravel mix make things like 
bundling assets, copying files, versioning so much easier and cleaner!

3) Start the dev server (with hot reload)

# Note
Currently this package is using uikit version 3.0.0-Beta.18 and it does not yet have sass support.  
This project is a very basic starting point on how uikit can be integrated with vue.js app by utilizing laravel mix.  
It is not required for you to be using the whole laravel php framework for this to work!  

And if you need a much better integration between uikit and vue, you should check out [vuikit](https://github.com/vuikit/vuikit).
